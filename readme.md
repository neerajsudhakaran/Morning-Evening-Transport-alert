# Wellington Bus & Weather Telegram Alerts using AWS Lambda

This project provides **automated Telegram alerts** for bus arrivals and daily weather in Wellington, NZ, using **AWS Lambda**. There are two types of alerts:

1. **Morning Alert (7:30‚ÄØAM NZST)** ‚Äì Provides both **bus schedule** and **daily weather forecast**.  
2. **Evening Alert (15‚ÄØmin prior to shift end)** ‚Äì Provides **bus schedule only** (no weather) for convenient planning after work.

## Motivation

Managing transport in Wellington can be tricky, especially on weekends.

During weekdays, buses run frequently, every 15‚Äì30 minutes, so missing one is rarely a big issue. Alerts in the morning or evening are helpful but not critical.

However, during weekends (Saturday & Sunday), things are different. Buses run less often, typically every 45‚Äì60 minutes. Some services may be cancelled, and others might arrive earlier than scheduled. This can be frustrating: while early arrivals might help some people reach home faster, for others it is annoying if they are okay waiting a little longer. Arriving 5‚Äì10 minutes early at the stop can easily cause a missed bus.

The morning alert gives an overview of the next buses and the weather forecast to plan the day.

The evening alert, sent 15 minutes before the end of a shift, ensures you know the next 4 buses, helping avoid missed rides home. This is particularly valuable on weekends when buses are sparse and timing is crucial.

By automating these alerts, we reduce the stress of checking schedules manually and help plan trips efficiently, especially when time-sensitive shifts and irregular weekend schedules come into play.

## Setup

### 1. AWS Lambda

- Runtime: **Python 3.11**
- Timeout: **10‚Äì15 seconds**
- Memory: 128‚ÄØMB

### 2. Environment Variables

Set these in Lambda for **both functions**:

| Variable            | Purpose                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`     | Telegram Bot API token            |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`   | Your chat ID                     |
| `METLINK_API_KEY`    | Metlink API key                  |
| `METEO_API_KEY`      | Meteosource API key (only morning Lambda) |

### 3. EventBridge Schedule

- **Morning alert** ‚Üí 7:30‚ÄØAM NZST  

cron(30 19 * * ? *)

- **Evening alert** ‚Üí 15‚ÄØminutes prior to end of work shift (adjust hours)  

> Remember: NZST = UTC +12 hours.

## Usage

1. Deploy each Lambda function separately.
2. Add the environment variables in the Lambda console.
3. Configure EventBridge rules for the appropriate time.
4. Ensure Telegram bot is created and your chat ID is correct.

üöÄ **On-Demand Alerts via Telegram Bot**

We can trigger the Lambda function instantly using our Telegram bot. This is especially helpful when we need alerts outside the normal schedule, for example when leaving for work at a different time.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Telegram Bot Setup**  
   - **Bot token:** `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`  
   - **Chat ID:** `YOUR_CHAT_ID`  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Available Commands**  
   - `/bus_now` ‚Äì Fetch the next 4 buses for our stop *immediately*.  
   - `/bus_custom HH:MM` ‚Äì Fetch bus schedules for a custom departure time.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Lambda Integration**  
   - The bot is connected to our **AWS Lambda function** via an **API Gateway endpoint**.  
   - Sending a command triggers the Lambda **instantly**, bypassing the scheduled EventBridge cron.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Benefits**  
   - ‚úÖ Access bus schedules on-demand.  
   - ‚úÖ Handle unexpected changes in departure times.  
   - ‚úÖ Useful anytime, not just during the morning or evening scheduled alerts.
